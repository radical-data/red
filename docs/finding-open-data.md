title: Finding Open Data
---

There is open data available all over the world, from the number of postboxes in a city to the number of refugees leaving Ukraine. In this module we'll learn where to find it.

!!! abstract "Learning objectives"
    - Find local data about Utrecht
    - Find global data

!!! example "Lesson plan"

    1. Explore Utrecht data
    2. Download some data
    3. Explore international data
    4. Find extremes of data
    5. Find data (ir)relevant to you
    6. Share what you found in small groups of 2-4 

!!! info "Requirements"
    Each participant needs:

    - A device with internet access

## Local Data

It can be eye-opening to find data about our local area. For example, we can find lots of datasets about Utrecht at [utrecht.dataplatform.nl](https://utrecht.dataplatform.nl).

[Check out Utrecht's Data Platform](https://utrecht.dataplatform.nl){ .md-button }

You can look for datasets that interest you by exploring areas that interest you through the [themes page](https://utrecht.dataplatform.nl/#/themes) or more specifically in the [data page](https://utrecht.dataplatform.nl/#/data).

!!! question "Exercise: Gimme the data"
    1. [ ] Find one dataset through the themes page that you find interesting
    2. [ ] Find one dataset through the data page that you find interesting
    3. [ ] Download a dataset as a `.csv` file
    4. [ ] Open the data. Which program does it open in by default?
    5. [ ] Have a look through the data. Do you have any initial questions about the data?

## Global Data

Though our street is important, some issues take place over a larger area. In these cases, we need to go...

... __GLOBAL__.

Fortunately there is so much data available, from satelitte data covering the whole world to the [3D migration flight data of bats](https://www.movebank.org/cms/webapp?gwt_fragment=page=studies,path=study625284084) to the [risk of collision with whales](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/risk-of-collision-with-whales).

Governments often host a range of open data. For example, the Dutch government has lots of data at [data.overheid.nl](https://data.overheid.nl/en).

NGOs do too and their data tends to cross multiple countries. One of my favourites is the [European Environmental Agency](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data).

We have compiled a list of interesting places for finding data one the [Resources](resources.md) page.

!!! question "Exercise: The Extremes of Data"
    Using any of the data resources:

    1. [ ] Find the most unusual dataset you can
    2. [ ] Find the most specific dataset you can
    3. [ ] Find the largest dataset you can
    4. [ ] Find the smallest dataset you can

In the [introduction](introduction.md) we spoke about how the goal of the course is to tell stories about what is important to us. The next exercise is about finding datasets that are important to us. As well as a few that are... very unimportant to us.

!!! question "Exercise: Data and Me"
    1. [ ] Find an interesting dataset
    2. [ ] Find the most boring dataset you can
    3. [ ] Find a dataset that is relevant to your life
    4. [ ] Find a dataset that is totally irrelevant to your life

## Conclusion

Through this, we should know where to look for environmental data about our local community as well as for global issues. We should know how to download that data and open it. We'll have also started to appreciate the range of data that is already collected out in the world. All this data can be brought into our projects to tell stories.
