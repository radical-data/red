!!! abstract "Learning objectives"
    - Find local data about Utrecht
    - Find global data

!!! example "Lesson plan"

    1. Explore Utrecht data
    2. Something
    3. Explore international data
    4. Find extremes of data
    5. Something
    6. Find data (ir)relevant to you
    7. Share what you found in small groups of 2-4 

!!! info "Requirements"
    Each participant needs:

    - A computer

## Local Data

It's cool to find data about our local area. There are lots of datasets about Utrecht at [utrecht.dataplatform.nl](https://utrecht.dataplatform.nl).

[Check out Utrecht's Data Platform](https://utrecht.dataplatform.nl){ .md-button }

You can look for datasets that interest you by exploring areas that interest you through the [themes page](https://utrecht.dataplatform.nl/#/themes) or more specifically in the [data page](https://utrecht.dataplatform.nl/#/data).

!!! question "Exercise: Gimme the data"
    1. [ ] Find one dataset through the themes page that you find interesting
    2. [ ] Find one dataset through the data page that you find interesting
    3. [ ] Download a dataset as a `.csv` file
    4. [ ] Open the data. Which program does it open in by default?
    5. [ ] Have a look through the data. Do you have any initial questions about the data?

## Global Data

Though our street is important, some issues take place over a larger area. In these cases, we need to go...

... __GLOBAL__.

Fortunately, there is so much data available, from satelitte data covering the whole world to the [3D migration flight data of bats](https://www.movebank.org/cms/webapp?gwt_fragment=page=studies,path=study625284084) to the [risk of collision with whales](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/risk-of-collision-with-whales).

Governments often host a range of open data:

- Netherlands: [data.overheid.nl](https://data.overheid.nl/en)
- UK open data: [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/)
- Ireland's Open Data Portal: [data.gov.ie](https://data.gov.ie/)

NGOs do too and their data tends to cross multiple countries:

- World Bank
- UN

For a comprehensive list, see the [Resources](resources.md) page.

!!! question "Exercise: The Extremes of Data"
    Looking across local and global datasets:

    1. [ ] Find the most unusual dataset you can
    2. [ ] Find the most specific dataset you can
    3. [ ] Find the largest dataset you can
    4. [ ] Find the smallest dataset you can

The goal of this course is to find datasets that can help us tell stories.

!!! question "Exercise: Data and Me"
    1. [ ] Find an interesting dataset
    2. [ ] Find the most boring dataset you can
    3. [ ] Find a dataset that is relevant to your life
    4. [ ] Find a dataset that is totally irrelevant to your life
