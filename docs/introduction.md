## Saving the World

### Why the environment?

In case you didn't know, our world is changing.

And not always in a good way.

Our air is changing. Our water is changing. Birds are changing where they fly to. Trees that survived thousands of years [are dying](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/grand-old-trees-are-dying-leaving-forests-younger-shorter) earlier than they should be.

### Why data?

The world we live in, for better or worse, _really_ values data. On the negative side, if there is something we want to share in the world, often other people dismiss our individual experiences[^1]. This has the strongest effect on people who already experience discrimination including women, queer people, people of colour and disabled people.

[^1]: For more details on this, the open access book [Data Feminism](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/) is a great resource.

In this data-driven world, knowing how to use data to tell stories is a superpower. Data can be a form of self-advocacy, showing that the things we care about are real and matter.

Sometimes people will only listen if we have the data.

This course focuses based on how we can tell stories with data.

### Why environmental data?

Climate change is an area where people's experiences have been ignored for a long time[^2]. Data can be a used as a tool to tell the stories about our changing world that need to be told.

[^2]: Many of the early warnings of climate change were from indiginous communities. Similarly, those most effected by it have been and will be poorer people.

It can also be used as a tool of changing the world. Locally, we can protect trees or improve air quality.

Globally, we can convince people to build movements and bring about international policy change.

## What have other people done?

Some cool projects.

## What will you get out of this course?

Projects we could do.

Documenting what's happening
We want to teach how to tell stories about how our world is changing and how it affects us.

Changing what's happening
We want to share how to create a data project that can change the world, or just the recycling system in your city.
