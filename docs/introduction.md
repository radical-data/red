### Why the environment?

In case you didn't know, our world is changing.

And not always in a good way.

Our air is changing. Our water is changing. Birds are changing where they fly to. Trees that survived thousands of years [are dying](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/grand-old-trees-are-dying-leaving-forests-younger-shorter) earlier than they should be.

### Why data?

The world we live in, for better or worse, _really_ values data[^1]. In this data-driven world, knowing how to use data to tell stories is a superpower.

[^1]: On the negative side, if there is something we want to share in the world, often other people dismiss our individual experiences. This has the strongest effect on people who already experience discrimination including women, queer people, people of colour and disabled people. For more details on this, the open access book [Data Feminism](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/) is a great resource.

Sometimes our experiences will be dismissed. In these cases, people will only listen if we have the data.

If we know how to work with data, we are able to share what is important to us and convince others.

<!-- Data can be a form of self-advocacy, showing that the things we care about are real and matter. -->

<!-- This course focuses on how to tell stories with data. -->

### Why environmental data?

Climate change is an area where people's experiences have been ignored for a long time[^2]. Data can be a used as a tool to tell the stories about our changing world that need to be told.

[^2]: Many of the early warnings of climate change were from indiginous communities. Similarly, those most effected by it have been and will be poorer people.

<!--It can also be used as a tool of changing the world. Locally, we can protect trees or improve air quality.-->

<!--Globally, we can convince people to build movements and bring about international policy change.-->

## What have other people done?

There are lots of great projects using environmental data. Let's look at two, one local example and one global.

### Peep Under the Elbe

[Peep Under the Elbe](http://critical-art.net/peep-under-the-elbe-2008/) was a project that analysed the quality of canal water to find clean swimming and fishing areas.

![Two people test water for the project 'Peep Under the Elbe'.](http://critical-art.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/elbe_03.jpg)

[Critical Art Collective](critical-art.net) worked with residents of Wilhelmsburg, a poor and neglected neighbourhood in Hamburg, to create tools and test the quality of the local water. The goal was to learn where the safest places for the popular activities of swimming and fishing.

!!! question "Ideas for an extension"
    _Do you have any thoughts about how this project could be extended?_
    Could we build a map to store all of this data? Could we combine this collected data with open data on land use?

### Environmental Racism in Death Alley

'Death Alley' (also known as [Cancer Alley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_Alley)) is an area along the Mississippi River that gets it's unfortunate name from the abnormally high rates of cancer. The area contains over 150 petroleum plants in less than 135km of land. These plants release toxic fumes into the air which enter the bodies of the people surrounding the area.

[Forensic Architecture](https://forensic-architecture.org/) used advanced techniques to document where the toxic air comes from and where it spreads to. [The data project](https://forensic-architecture.org/investigation/environmental-racism-in-death-alley-louisiana) has been used by local communities to demand accountability and reparations for the medical issues this has caused.

## What will you get out of this course?

Within this course, we'll learn how to:

- find data about the environment
- look at it critiquely
- collect our own and
- visualise it to tell stories

We'll learn the tools to do everything from building a visualisation of the the melting of glaciers to collecting data on cut trees in the city we live in.

There are two goals:

1. *We want to __document__ what's happening in our world.* We want to teach how to tell stories about how our world is changing and how it affects us.
1. *We want to __change__ what's happening.* We want to share how to create a data project that can change the world, or just the recycling system in your city.

This course is designed to help us do that.
