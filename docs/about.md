# About

Radical Environmental Data is a course on working with environmental data. It is a collaboration between [Creative Coding Utrecht](https://creativecodingutrecht.nl/) and [Radical Data](https://radicaldata.org).

It was initially developed for a program of workshops for young people in Utrecht.

## Design

The website is open source and available at [github.com/radicaldataproject](https://github.com/radicaldataproject).

It uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate the static site and uses [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material) as the basis of the theme.

The logo is [Trees](https://thenounproject.com/icon/trees-933040/) by [Creative Mania](https://thenounproject.com/CreativeMania/) from [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com).
