## What is this?

This is a course designed for introducing people to finding, analysing and visualising environmental data.

It is intended to be modular, with each section working independently.

## Who is it for?

The modular design of the course means that it is accessible for different levels. Whilst some modules are open to everyone, some of them require some amount of coding experience.

## How should I learn from it?

 Instructors or self-studiers can look [here](for-instructors.md) for suggestions on designing a program.
