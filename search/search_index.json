In this module we'll learn where to find it. Learning objectives Find local data about Utrecht Find global data Lesson plan Explore Utrecht data Download some data Explore international data Find extremes of data Find data (ir)relevant to you Share what you found in small groups of 2-4 Requirements Each participant needs: A device with internet access Local Data It can be eye-opening to find data about our local area. For example, we can find lots of datasets about Utrecht at utrecht.dataplatform.nl . Check out Utrecht's Data Platform You can look for datasets that interest you by exploring areas that interest you through the themes page or more specifically in the data page . Exercise: Gimme the data Find one dataset through the themes page that you find interesting Find one dataset through the data page that you find interesting Download a dataset as a .csv file Open the data. Which program does it open in by default? Have a look through the data. Do you have any initial questions about the data? Global Data Though our street is important, some issues take place over a larger area. In these cases, we need to go... ... GLOBAL . Fortunately there is so much data available, from satelitte data covering the whole world to the 3D migration flight data of bats to the risk of collision with whales . Governments often host a range of open data. For example, the Dutch government has lots of data at data.overheid.nl . NGOs do too and their data tends to cross multiple countries. One of my favourites is the European Environmental Agency . We have compiled a list of interesting places for finding data one the Resources page. Exercise: The Extremes of Data Using any of the data resources: Find the most unusual dataset you can Find the most specific dataset you can Find the largest dataset you can Find the smallest dataset you can In the introduction we spoke about how the goal of the course is to tell stories about what is important to us. The next exercise is about finding datasets that are important to us. As well as a few that are... very unimportant to us. Exercise: Data and Me Find an interesting dataset Find the most boring dataset you can Find a dataset that is relevant to your life Find a dataset that is totally irrelevant to your life Conclusion Through this, we should know where to look for environmental data about our local community as well as for global issues. We should know how to download that data and open it. We'll have also started to appreciate the range of data that is already collected out in the world. All this data can be brought into our projects to tell stories.","title":"Finding Open Data"},{"location":"finding-open-data/#local-data","text":"It can be eye-opening to find data about our local area.

How? Radical Coding Why the environment? In case you didn't know, our world is changing. And not always in a good way. Burnt giant sequoias in California after a wildfire. Our air is changing. Our water is changing. Birds are changing where they fly to. Trees that survived thousands of years are dying earlier than they should be. Why data? The world we live in, for better or worse, really values data 1 . In this data-driven world, knowing how to use data to tell stories is a superpower. Sometimes our experiences will be dismissed. In these cases, people will only listen if we have the data. If we know how to work with data, we are able to share what is important to us and convince others. Why environmental data? Climate change is an area where people's experiences have been ignored for a long time 2 . Data can be a used as a tool to tell the stories about our changing world that need to be told. What have other people done? There are lots of great projects using environmental data. Let's look at two, one local example and one global. Peep Under the Elbe Peep Under the Elbe was a project that analysed the quality of canal water to find clean swimming and fishing areas. Critical Art Collective worked with residents of Wilhelmsburg, a poor and neglected neighbourhood in Hamburg, to create tools and test the quality of the local water. The goal was to learn where the safest places for the popular activities of swimming and fishing. Ideas for an extension Do you have any thoughts about how this project could be extended? Could we build a map to store all of this data? Could we combine this collected data with open data on land use? Environmental Racism in Death Alley 'Death Alley' (also known as Cancer Alley ) is an area along the Mississippi River that gets it's unfortunate name from the abnormally high rates of cancer. The area contains over 150 petroleum plants in less than 135km of land. These plants release toxic fumes into the air which enter the bodies of the people surrounding the area. Forensic Architecture used advanced techniques to document where the toxic air comes from and where it spreads to. The data project has been used by local communities to demand accountability and reparations for the medical issues this has caused. What will you get out of this course? Within this course, we'll learn how to: find data about the environment look at it critiquely collect our own and visualise it to tell stories We'll learn the tools to do everything from building a visualisation of the the melting of glaciers to collecting data on cut trees in the city we live in. There are two goals: We want to document what's happening in our world. We want to teach how to tell stories about how our world is changing and how it affects us. We want to change what's happening. We want to share how to create a data project that can change the world, or just the recycling system in your city. This course is designed to help us do that. On the negative side, if there is something we want to share in the world, often other people dismiss our individual experiences. This has the strongest effect on people who already experience discrimination including women, queer people, people of colour and disabled people. For more details on this, the open access book Data Feminism is a great resource. \u21a9 Many of the early warnings of climate change were from indiginous communities.
