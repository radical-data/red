If you completed the Finding Open Data module, look back and see if there are any datasets that interested you from there. If you didn't, no problem. Here are three datasets that you can choose from for this exercise. Register of CCTV cameras in Utrecht Air Quality in Utrecht Risk of Collision with Whales To prepare, open the dataset in your computer and go to the webpage where it was downloaded from. Ready? Interrogation The goal of this module is to understand that datasets are not perfect clean things. They are messy abstractions made by people. A lot of choices go into making a dataset. Limits Let's start easy(ish). What does your data include? Exercise: Overview In your dataset, what is measured? Datasets cannot include everything. [Examples of datasets and the things that aren't measured] Exercise: The missing What isn't measured on purpose? For example, if the dataset is about CCTV cameras, does it include all CCTV cameras or does have only council cameras and leave out private cameras? What important related things aren't measured? For a dataset about fish, does it include squid? Or sharks? What things could be missing due to the data collection process? For example, if the dataset is about homeless people, there are many ways a homeless person would not be included in the data collection.

This module will teach us how to create 'data sculptures', representations of data in 3D. We are going to use Blender to build a digital version of our data sculpture first. When we have it ready, we can export it to print in a 3D printer. Learning objectives Be able to explain what a data sculpture is Use Python within Blender Use a 3D printer to create a physical data sculpture Lesson plan Learn what a data sculpture is See some examples of data sculptures Find data that will work well as a data sculpture Create a digital data sculpture in Blender 3D print the data sculpture Requirements Each participant needs: A device with internet access Blender Access to a 3D printer What is a Data Sculpture A data sculpture is a representation of data in 3D. Why would we want to do that? For a similar reason people have made sculptures instead of painting everything. Sculpture makes things real, placing them in our physical world. It is also able to represent more complexity than a 2D object. This is particularly important for us as data scientists wanting to communicate issues with data. Examples This idea might feel a bit strange but it is easiest to understand with some examples. Gilles Azzaro's piece 'Barack Obama: Next Industrial Revolution' represents the audio of an Obama speech as a data sculpture. ( Source .) Peter Jellitsch\u2019s \"Bleecker Street Documents\" shows the wifi signal in an apartment changing through time. ( Source .) We can also represent data very accurately and more literally. The Making Data Matter project focuses on using physicalisation to give insights to datasets. A piece from the Making Data Matter project. ( Source .) Find data that deserves a sculpture For our data sculpture, it is best if we choose a dataset and choose three variables that we would like to show from that. For this lesson, two of the variables should be independent variables and one should be dependent 1 . For example: Independent Dependent Latitude and longitude Height above sea level Year and month Amount of rainfall in Utrecht The x and y position of a pixel in a photo The brightness of the pixel For this example I'm going to use a dataset of global temperatures from 1880. I downloaded it from here and did a miminal clean of it. You can download the cleaned version here . Build a digital data sculpture We are going to use Blender to build a digital version of our data sculpture first. When we have it ready, we can export it to print in a 3d printer. Download Blender. Open Blender to a new project. Download this script I wrote. Open the script in Blender's text editor. Set the file to point to your dataset, which should be in a .csv format. Run the script to create the object. You should now have a digital data sculpture representing your dataset. Exercise (Optional): Polishing the data sculpture If you want, you can add materials to the object, play with the lighting and even animate the camera. Check out at a Blender tutorial if it is new to you. Use 3D printing to make a physical data sculpture Export the object as an .obj file. Import the file in 3D printing software. Prepare it. Print it. Extensions Exercise (Optional): Getting creative Use data of a different form, for example with two dependent variables. In the Extensions section, we can try more adventurous datasets. \u21a9","title":"Making a Data Sculpture"},{"location":"data-sculptures/#making-a-data-sculpture","text":"Data can be complex and not easily represented in 2D.

For example, we can find lots of datasets about Utrecht at utrecht.dataplatform.nl . Check out Utrecht's Data Platform You can look for datasets that interest you by exploring areas that interest you through the themes page or more specifically in the data page . Exercise: Gimme the data Find one dataset through the themes page that you find interesting Find one dataset through the data page that you find interesting Download a dataset as a .csv file Open the data.

How? Radical Coding Why the environment? In case you didn't know, our world is changing. And not always in a good way. Burnt giant sequoias in California after a wildfire. Our air is changing. Our water is changing. Birds are changing where they fly to. Trees that survived thousands of years are dying earlier than they should be. Why data? The world we live in, for better or worse, really values data 1 . In this data-driven world, knowing how to use data to tell stories is a superpower. Sometimes our experiences will be dismissed. In these cases, people will only listen if we have the data. If we know how to work with data, we are able to share what is important to us and convince others. Why environmental data? Climate change is an area where people's experiences have been ignored for a long time 2 . Data can be a used as a tool to tell the stories about our changing world that need to be told. What have other people done? There are lots of great projects using environmental data. Let's look at two, one local example and one global. Peep Under the Elbe Peep Under the Elbe was a project that analysed the quality of canal water to find clean swimming and fishing areas. Critical Art Collective worked with residents of Wilhelmsburg, a poor and neglected neighbourhood in Hamburg, to create tools and test the quality of the local water. The goal was to learn where the safest places for the popular activities of swimming and fishing. Ideas for an extension Do you have any thoughts about how this project could be extended? Could we build a map to store all of this data? Could we combine this collected data with open data on land use? Environmental Racism in Death Alley 'Death Alley' (also known as Cancer Alley ) is an area along the Mississippi River that gets it's unfortunate name from the abnormally high rates of cancer. The area contains over 150 petroleum plants in less than 135km of land. These plants release toxic fumes into the air which enter the bodies of the people surrounding the area. Forensic Architecture used advanced techniques to document where the toxic air comes from and where it spreads to. The data project has been used by local communities to demand accountability and reparations for the medical issues this has caused. What will you get out of this course? Within this course, we'll learn how to: find data about the environment look at it critiquely collect our own and visualise it to tell stories We'll learn the tools to do everything from building a visualisation of the the melting of glaciers to collecting data on cut trees in the city we live in. There are two goals: We want to document what's happening in our world. We want to teach how to tell stories about how our world is changing and how it affects us. We want to change what's happening. We want to share how to create a data project that can change the world, or just the recycling system in your city. This course is designed to help us do that. On the negative side, if there is something we want to share in the world, often other people dismiss our individual experiences. This has the strongest effect on people who already experience discrimination including women, queer people, people of colour and disabled people. For more details on this, the open access book Data Feminism is a great resource. \u21a9 Many of the early warnings of climate change were from indiginous communities.

This module will teach us how to create 'data sculptures', representations of data in 3D. We are going to use Blender to build a digital version of our data sculpture first. When we have it ready, we can export it to print in a 3D printer. Learning objectives Be able to explain what a data sculpture is Use Python within Blender Use a 3D printer to create a physical data sculpture Lesson plan Learn what a data sculpture is See some examples of data sculptures Find data that will work well as a data sculpture Create a digital data sculpture in Blender 3D print the data sculpture Requirements Each participant needs: A device with internet access Blender Access to a 3D printer What is a Data Sculpture A data sculpture is a representation of data in 3D. Why would we want to do that? For a similar reason people have made sculptures instead of painting everything. Sculpture makes things real, placing them in our physical world. It is also able to represent more complexity than a 2D object. This is particularly important for us as data scientists wanting to communicate issues with data. Examples This idea might feel a bit strange but it is easiest to understand with some examples. Gilles Azzaro's piece 'Barack Obama: Next Industrial Revolution' represents the audio of an Obama speech as a data sculpture. ( Source .) Peter Jellitsch\u2019s \"Bleecker Street Documents\" shows the wifi signal in an apartment changing through time. ( Source .) We can also represent data very accurately and more literally. The Making Data Matter project focuses on using physicalisation to give insights to datasets. A piece from the Making Data Matter project. ( Source .) Find data that deserves a sculpture For our data sculpture, it is best if we choose a dataset and choose three variables that we would like to show from that. For this lesson, two of the variables should be independent variables and one should be dependent 1 . For example: Independent Dependent Latitude and longitude Height above sea level Year and month Amount of rainfall in Utrecht The x and y position of a pixel in a photo The brightness of the pixel For this example I'm going to use a dataset of global temperatures from 1880. I downloaded it from here and did a miminal clean of it. You can download the cleaned version here . Build a digital data sculpture We are going to use Blender to build a digital version of our data sculpture first. When we have it ready, we can export it to print in a 3d printer. Download Blender. Open Blender to a new project. Download this script I wrote. Open the script in Blender's text editor. Set the file to point to your dataset, which should be in a .csv format. Run the script to create the object. You should now have a digital data sculpture representing your dataset. Exercise (Optional): Polishing the data sculpture If you want, you can add materials to the object, play with the lighting and even animate the camera. Check out at a Blender tutorial if it is new to you. Use 3D printing to make a physical data sculpture Export the object as an .obj file. Import the file in 3D printing software. Prepare it. Print it. Extensions Exercise (Optional): Getting creative Use data of a different form, for example with two dependent variables.

How? Radical Coding Why the environment? In case you didn't know, our world is changing. And not always in a good way. Burnt giant sequoias in California after a wildfire. Our air is changing. Our water is changing. Birds are changing where they fly to. Trees that survived thousands of years are dying earlier than they should be. Why data? The world we live in, for better or worse, really values data 1 . In this data-driven world, knowing how to use data to tell stories is a superpower. Sometimes our experiences will be dismissed. In these cases, people will only listen if we have the data. If we know how to work with data, we are able to share what is important to us and convince others. Why environmental data? Climate change is an area where people's experiences have been ignored for a long time 2 . Data can be a used as a tool to tell the stories about our changing world that need to be told. What have other people done? There are lots of great projects using environmental data. Let's look at two, one local example and one global. Peep Under the Elbe Peep Under the Elbe was a project that analysed the quality of canal water to find clean swimming and fishing areas. Critical Art Collective worked with residents of Wilhelmsburg, a poor and neglected neighbourhood in Hamburg, to create tools and test the quality of the local water. The goal was to learn where the safest places for the popular activities of swimming and fishing. Ideas for an extension Do you have any thoughts about how this project could be extended? Could we build a map to store all of this data? Could we combine this collected data with open data on land use? Environmental Racism in Death Alley 'Death Alley' (also known as Cancer Alley ) is an area along the Mississippi River that gets it's unfortunate name from the abnormally high rates of cancer. The area contains over 150 petroleum plants in less than 135km of land. These plants release toxic fumes into the air which enter the bodies of the people surrounding the area. Forensic Architecture used advanced techniques to document where the toxic air comes from and where it spreads to. The data project has been used by local communities to demand accountability and reparations for the medical issues this has caused. What will you get out of this course? Within this course, we'll learn how to: find data about the environment look at it critiquely collect our own and visualise it to tell stories We'll learn the tools to do everything from building a visualisation of the the melting of glaciers to collecting data on cut trees in the city we live in. There are two goals: We want to document what's happening in our world. We want to teach how to tell stories about how our world is changing and how it affects us. We want to change what's happening. We want to share how to create a data project that can change the world, or just the recycling system in your city. This course is designed to help us do that. On the negative side, if there is something we want to share in the world, often other people dismiss our individual experiences. This has the strongest effect on people who already experience discrimination including women, queer people, people of colour and disabled people. For more details on this, the open access book Data Feminism is a great resource. \u21a9 Many of the early warnings of climate change were from indiginous communities.
