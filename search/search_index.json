In this module we'll learn where to find it. Learning objectives Find local data about Utrecht Find global data Lesson plan Explore Utrecht data Something Explore international data Find extremes of data Something Find data (ir)relevant to you Share what you found in small groups of 2-4 Requirements Each participant needs: A computer Local Data It's cool to find data about our local area. There are lots of datasets about Utrecht at utrecht.dataplatform.nl . Check out Utrecht's Data Platform You can look for datasets that interest you by exploring areas that interest you through the themes page or more specifically in the data page . Exercise: Gimme the data Find one dataset through the themes page that you find interesting Find one dataset through the data page that you find interesting Download a dataset as a .csv file Open the data. Which program does it open in by default? Have a look through the data. Do you have any initial questions about the data? Global Data Though our street is important, some issues take place over a larger area. In these cases, we need to go... ... GLOBAL . Fortunately, there is so much data available, from satelitte data covering the whole world to the 3D migration flight data of bats to the risk of collision with whales . Governments often host a range of open data: Netherlands: data.overheid.nl UK open data: data.gov.uk Ireland's Open Data Portal: data.gov.ie NGOs do too and their data tends to cross multiple countries: World Bank UN For a comprehensive list, see the Resources page. Exercise: The Extremes of Data Looking across local and global datasets: Find the most unusual dataset you can Find the most specific dataset you can Find the largest dataset you can Find the smallest dataset you can The goal of this course is to find datasets that can help us tell stories. Exercise: Data and Me Find an interesting dataset Find the most boring dataset you can Find a dataset that is relevant to your life Find a dataset that is totally irrelevant to your life","title":"Finding Open Data"},{"location":"finding-open-data/#local-data","text":"It's cool to find data about our local area.

Why? Saving the World Why the environment? In case you didn't know, our world is changing. And not always in a good way. Burnt giant sequoias in California after a wildfire. Our air is changing. Our water is changing. Birds are changing where they fly to. Trees that survived thousands of years are dying earlier than they should be. Why data? The world we live in, for better or worse, really values data. On the negative side, if there is something we want to share in the world, often other people dismiss our individual experiences 1 . This has the strongest effect on people who already experience discrimination including women, queer people, people of colour and disabled people. In this data-driven world, knowing how to use data to tell stories is a superpower. Data can be a form of self-advocacy, showing that the things we care about are real and matter. Sometimes people will only listen if we have the data. This course focuses based on how we can tell stories with data. Why environmental data? Climate change is an area where people's experiences have been ignored for a long time 2 . Data can be a used as a tool to tell the stories about our changing world that need to be told. It can also be used as a tool of changing the world. Locally, we can protect trees or improve air quality. Globally, we can convince people to build movements and bring about international policy change. What have other people done? Some cool projects. What will you get out of this course? Projects we could do. Documenting what's happening We want to teach how to tell stories about how our world is changing and how it affects us. Changing what's happening We want to share how to create a data project that can change the world, or just the recycling system in your city.
